High Level Documentation
Process Documentation: issues, PRs, msg #34, git commits.



Open-Sourcing Doxxu:

In most of software projects I worked on, documentation was either missing entirely or it was incomplete and outdated. It's very short-sighted. It takes longer to every developer to figure out how everything works and what the dependencies are. That costs money.

Onboarding.
Issues #x, PRs


# What Most Companies Are Mising?
But more importantly, lack of certain information (especially combined with lack of tests) might cause a new developer to change code in a non-compatible fashion.

There are two types of documentation: <b>low-level API documentation</b> and <b>high-level documentation</b>. Both are important, but the code is the easy thing to figure out.

The high level setup might often be much less obvious. Funny enough, it's usually the high level documentation which is often missing (in commercial projects).


There are many possibilities how to write such documentation. Many people use GitHub Wiki (powered by <a href="https://github.com/gollum/gollum">Gollum</a>). It's very nice system

There's one thing I don't like about GitHub Wikis: it uses different repository for the documentation. Why's that not good? Well, what if you want to switch to some point in the past or what if you're working on a topic branch?

Besides there's already a convention for writing documentation: README files.
That means
