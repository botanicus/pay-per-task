**TODO**: Describe what it is

## TODO

- I want to be able to use ng-include
<div ng-include="/source/webs/api.pay-per-task.com/puma.config.rb">
</div>
- Integrate subl:// to open files.
- Instead of using two subdomains, use just one. Code shall live on `/source/:path`. By doing so we can also eliminate the SCE whitelist.
- Come up with production settings (authentication etc).
- Make it OSS.
- Make it installable through Bower?
- Add it as a submodule OR install through Bower.
- Handling non-existing files like http://docs.pay-per-task.dev/docs/pornhub.md
