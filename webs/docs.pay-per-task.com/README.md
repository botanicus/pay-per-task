## TODO

- Instead of using two subdomains, use just one. Code shall live on `/source/:path`. By doing so we can also eliminate the SCE whitelist.
- Come up with production settings (authentication etc).
- Make it OSS.
- Make it installable through Bower?
- Add it as a submodule OR install through Bower.
