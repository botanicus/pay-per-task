        <span style="font-size: 30px; font-style: italic;">Imagine</span> how great would it <em>feel</em> if your developers were motivated? If the cared about the business objectives and deadlines?
      </p>
    
      <p>
        Wouldn't it be great to concentrate on the <strong>CREATIVE</strong> part of your business? To be a happy business owner?
      </p>
    
      
      <p>
        Don't worry! Managing teams efficiently and getting your money’s worth <strong>IS possible</strong>!
      </p>
    
      
      <p>
        Employees don't think like business people. They might be great at whatever they do, but they <strong>don't understand</strong> you and your business.
      </p>
    
      
      <p>
        If you are wasting a lot of time managing people, <strong>it's NOT your fault!</strong> Most of the companies do.
      </p>
    
      
      <p>
        It's hard enough to deal with your employees, but now, the economic crisis makes running a successful business even harder and our government is not exactly helping matters.
      </p>
    
      
      <p>
        Here's a secret which will put you MILES ahead of your competition:
      </p>
    
      <p style="background-color: lightgreen">
        <em>You CANNOT possibly motivate anyone by giving them a list of tasks and a fixed rate!</em>
      </p>
    
      <p>
        Let me repeat it: <em>You CANNOT possibly motivate anyone by giving them a list of tasks and a fixed rate!</em>
      </p>
    
      <p>
        That's right. The average person won't be efficient and the efficient people will leave, because it's them who's doing most of the work.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        Well, be careful here! Neither can you ask people to be paid on a per project basis! It's a huge risk individual contractors cannot afford to take.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        So the solution is ...
      </p>
    
      <p>... WAIT FOR IT ...</p>
    
      <p>
        To pay them per ... task! Yeah, that's right! I mean think about it: you already have a task system in place, don't you? Whether it's Pivotal Tracker, Jira or Teambox.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        So why don't you do it? Because it'd be a lot of hassle. I know. But that's where PPT comes in! We nailed that one and in fact I'm happy to tell you that this will not only SKYROCKET motivation amongst your dev team, it will also significantly REDUCE paperwork.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        "But I'll have to change my issue tracker for your solution, right?"
        <br>
        "Wrong! You won't have to change a damn thing! Keep whatever systems you are using and just plug in this little component which will work its ass off without you even noticing it's there!"
      </p>
    
      <p>
        How does it work? First register and enable the plugin. You will receive a step-by-step explanation in the email you'll receive upon registration. You create a story in issue tracker and you put a price tag into the description.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        From the pool of available stories, each developer can select whichever story gives him the best ROI based on his unique skills and experience.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        Once he's done, he changes the status to "finished". As usual. Then you'll get a notification about it, again, as usual and you review it. If you're happy with the work, you accept the story.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        At that point, you'll be issued with an invoice on behalf of your developer and money for the story will be sent to his account immediately.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        Developers will to love it, because they get the money in real time. That's a huge deal for freelancers, to be sure that they get paid and to get paid often.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        As you can see, this is a unique product. It will help make you many thousands of dollars every month, I could easily charge hundreds of dollars for it.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        But I'm not going to. I'm really passionate about changing the way companies work. The current system is fundamentally broken and brings misery to both entrepreneurs and their employees.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        Of course it can't be free either, since I'm paying the best people I know to work on this. It is pretty cheap though. Especially considering the value you’ll get. The price depends on the team size though, so go check out our <a href="/pricing">pricing</a>.
