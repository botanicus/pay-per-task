Landing page for the contractors. It happens to have A LOT of benefits for them as well: they get paid IN REALTIME and BASED ON THEIR EFFICIENCY rather than flat rate.

<!-- Encourage their dreams. -->
<p>
  No need to chase clients for money
  Get paid in real time
  Get paid for you disurve, NOT what all your lazy coleagues gets!
  No invoicing
</p>

<!-- Calm their fears. -->
<p>
  <!-- It IS possible! -->
</p>

<!-- Confirm their suspicions. -->
<p>
</p>

<!-- Justify their failures. -->
<p>
  <!-- It's NOT your fault! -->
</p>

<!-- Help them throw rocks at their enemies. -->
<p>
  It's hard enough to stay up to date with constantly changing technology when you're trying to have a life and now you should even chase clients for the money they owe you?

  "I should know. I've been contracting since I was 19. Before I learnt how to walk in the industry, I ended up eating only bread for couple of weeks. Not much of fun really." <a href="https://twitter.com/botanicus">@botanicus</a>, founder of PPT.
