  <!-- Encourage their dreams. -->
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 30px; font-style: italic;">Imagine </span> how great would it <em>feel</em> if developers would be motivated? Making them care about the business objectives and deadlines?
  </p>

  <p>
    Wouldn't it be great to concentrate on the <strong>CREATIVE</strong> part of business? To be a happy business owner?
  </p>

  <!-- Calm their fears. -->
  <p>
    Don't worry! Managing teams efficiently and getting your money worth <strong>IS possible</strong>!
  </p>

  <!-- Confirm their suspicions. -->
  <p>
    Employees mostly don't posses business thinking. They might be great at whatever they do, but <strong>they don't understand</strong> you and your business.
  </p>

  <!-- Justify their failures. -->
  <p>
    If you are wasting a lot of time on managing people, <strong>It's NOT your fault!</strong> Most of the companies do.
  </p>

  <!-- Help them throw rocks at their enemies. -->
  <p>
    It's hard enough to deal with your employees, but now, with the crisis, running a successful business is even harder and government is not exactly helping either.

  <!-- The product. -->
  <p>
    Here's a secret which makes you MILES ahead of your competition:
  </p>

  <p style="background-color: lightgreen">
    <em>You CANNOT possibly motivate anyone by giving them a list of task and a fixed rate!</em>
  </p>

  <p>
    Let me repeat it: <em>You CANNOT possibly motivate anyone by giving them a list of task and a fixed rate!</em>
  </p>

  <p>
    That's right. The average people won't be efficient and the efficient people will leave, because it's them who's doing most of the work.
  </p>

  <p>
    Well, but careful here! Neither can you ask people to be paid on per project basis! It's a huge risk small contractor cannot undertake.
  </p>

  <p>
    So the solution is ...
  </p>

  <p>... WAIT FOR IT ...</p>

  <p>
    To paid them per ... task! Yeah, that's right! I mean think about it: you're already have some task system in place, don't you? Whether it's Pivotal Tracker, Jira or Teambox.
  </p>

  <p>
    So why don't you do it? Because it'd be a lot of hassle. I know. But that's when PPT comes in! We nailed that one and in fact I'm happy to tell you that this will not only SKYROCKETS motivation of your dev team, it also significantly REDUCES paperwork.
  </p>

  <p>
    "But I'll have to change my issue tracker for your solution, right?"
    <br>
    "Wrong! You won't have to change a damn thing! Keep whatever systems you are using and just plug in this little component which will just work its arse out without you even noticing it's there!"
  </p>

  <p>
    How does it work? First register and enable the plugin. You'll be explained how in an email you'll receive upon registration. You create a story in issue tracker and you put a price tag into the story description.
  </p>

  <p>
    From pool of these stories, each developer will take whichever story that gives him the best ROI based on his unique skills and experience.
  </p>

  <p>
    Once he's done, he changes status to "finished". As usual. Then you'll get a notification about it, again, as usual and you can get review it. If you're happy with the work, you accept the story.
  </p>

  <p>
    At that point, you'll be issued invoice on behalf of your developer and money for the story will be send to his account immediately.
  </p>

  <p>
    So actually even developers are going to love it, because they get the money in real time. That's a huge deal for freelancers, to be sure that they get paid and to get paid often.
  </p>

  <p>
    As you can see, this is a unique product. Since it will make you many thousands of dollars every month, I could easily charge thousands of dollars for it.
  </p>

  <p>
    But I'm not going to. I'm really passionate about changing the way companies work. The current system is fundamentally wrong and brings misery to both entrepreneurs and their employees.
  </p>

  <p>
    Of course it can't be free either, since I'm paying the best people I know to work on this. It is pretty cheap though. Especially considering the value you're getting. The price depends on the team size though, so go to check the <a href="/pricing/">pricing</a>.
