    <!-- Encourage their dreams. -->
    <p>
      Haven't you always wanted a company that "just works"? Where <strong>YOU can do the productive work</strong>, the work which is worth your time instead of constantly making sure your employees are working on what they're supposed to?
    </p>

    <!-- Calm their fears. -->
    <p>
      Don't worry - managing teams efficiently and getting your money worth <strong>IS possible</strong>!
    </p>

    <!-- Confirm their suspicions. -->
    <p>
      Employees mostly don't posses business thinking. They might be great at whatever they do, but <strong>they don't understand</strong> you and your business.
    </p>

    <!-- Justify their failures. -->
    <p>
      If you are wasting a lot of time on managing people, <strong>It's NOT your fault!</strong> Most of the companies do.
    </p>

    <!-- Help them throw rocks at their enemies. -->
    <p>
      It's hard enough to deal with
    </p>

    <!-- The product. -->
    <p>
      And I have another good news for you: you don't have to change anything about the way you work! We integrate with existing solutions

      Software on the screenshot is Teambox. All you need to do is to put a price tag into the story title. Someone takes over the task, implement it and submit for QA. Once you approve it, invoice on behave of the person is generated, send over to you and money are automatically send to his account.
