# Those are dependencies of ppt. We can leave it up to RubyGems
# to handle them, but then we'd have to create a new release
# and run bundle update every time we'd want to update the code.
#
# Local overrides through bundle config local.GEMNAME don't work
# either if the gem is specified in ppt.gemspec rather than in here.
