# Scalling

*PPT runs on one VPS which most likely will be plenty. I'm therefore not overly concerned about scalling, I'm all trying to do is to make it possible to scale if needed.*

That consists of:

- Using software which can be (reasonably easily) clustered.
- Developing the app in such manner that it can go to cloud easily.

# Current Limitations

Consumer **ppt.inbox.backup** saves everything to the file system.
